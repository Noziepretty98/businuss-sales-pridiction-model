## Project Description

This project aims to predict sales using historical transaction data. The trained model is a Random Forest Regressor, which uses features such as `feature1` and `feature2` to predict the target variable (sales). This project includes a FastAPI-based API that allows users to make predictions by sending POST requests with input data.

## Installation Instructions

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `fastapi`
  - `uvicorn`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `joblib`

### Install Dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies, create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```txt
fastapi
uvicorn
pandas
scikit-learn
joblib

pip install -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
uvicorn app:app --reload

{
  "feature1": 3.5,
  "feature2": 7.2
}

{
  "prediction": 150.5
}


### Steps to Customize:
1. Replace `your-username` and `your-repository-name` in the Git clone URL with your actual GitHub username and repository name.
2. Update any specific features or details about your project if needed.
